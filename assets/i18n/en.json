		"TITLE": "About Us",
		"TEXT": "2nd Party Media, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMC Networks. Since 2015, our products have been defined and forged by close internal alliances between AMCN’s Business Intelligence, Research, Pricing & Inventory, Sales, Marketing, Scheduling and Programming departments to address the ever-changing and growing demands of running a Linear TV business, while other new businesses in video emerge. Most of 2nd Party Media products have had over 3 years of “product-market-fit” through the testing, deployment and adoption of these products widely by AMCN team members and key departments. Out of both necessity and lack of real-market alternatives, AMCN realized it had assets that the universal TV Media and Video markets could benefit, whether in whole or in part. In 2019, we formed 2nd Party Media and began to engage our partners to solve, with our software expertise, the most critical and important problems facing our businesses today. Our mutual and focused goals being Efficiency, Computational Speed, and Cost-Effectiveness.",
